	abstract = {Background and aims US tobacco companies owned leading US food companies from 1980 to 2001. We measured whether hyper-palatable foods (HPF) were disproportionately developed in tobacco-owned food companies, resulting in substantial tobacco-related influence on the US food system. Design The study involved a review of primary industry documents to identify food brands that were tobacco company-owned. Data sets from the US Department of Agriculture were integrated to facilitate longitudinal analyses estimating the degree to which foods were formulated to be hyper-palatable, based on tobacco ownership. Setting and cases United States Department of Agriculture data sets were used to identify HPF foods that were (n = 105) and were not (n = 587) owned by US tobacco companies from 1988 to 2001. Measurements A standardized definition from Fazzino et al. (2019) was used to identify HPF. HPF items were identified overall and by HPF group: fat and sodium HPF, fat and sugar HPF and carbohydrates and sodium HPF. Findings Tobacco-owned foods were 29\% more likely to be classified as fat and sodium HPF and 80\% more likely to be classified as carbohydrate and sodium HPF than foods that were not tobacco-owned between 1988 and 2001 (P-values = 0.005–0.009). The availability of fat and sodium HPF ({\textgreater} 57\%) and carbohydrate and sodium HPF ({\textgreater} 17\%) was high in 2018 regardless of prior tobacco-ownership status, suggesting widespread saturation into the food system. Conclusions Tobacco companies appear to have selectively disseminated hyper-palatable foods into the US food system between 1988 and 2001.},

	abstract = {Objective
Hyper-palatable foods (HPF) contain nutrient combinations that are hypothesized to maximize their rewarding effects during consumption. Due to their strong reinforcing properties, HPF are hypothesized to lead to greater energy intake within a meal. However, this premise has not been tested in free-living conditions. The current study examined the association between within-meal HPF intake and 1) measured energy intake and 2) self-reported overeating, assessed within eating occasions using smartphone-based food photography methodology.
Methods
A total of 29 participants reported food intake and eating experiences (N=345 total eating occasions) in real-time for 4 days using smartphone-based food photography methodology. HPF were identified using a standardized definition. Bayesian multilevel modeling was conducted to investigate the within-person effects of proportional calorie intake from HPF (\%kcal from HPF) on total energy intake and subjective overeating. Pre-meal hunger and proportional energy intake from high energy dense (HED) foods were included as covariates.
Results
Results revealed that when participants consumed more \%kcal from HPF than their average, they consumed greater total energy during eating occasions, even when controlling for pre-meal hunger and \%kcal from HED foods (median β = 0.09, 95\% HDI [0.02, 0.16], pd. = 99.56\%). Additionally, consuming more \%kcal from HPF than average was associated with greater eating despite feeling full, when controlling covariates (median β = 0.15, 95\% HDI [-0.02, 0.34], pd = 96.45\%).
Conclusions
The findings supported the premise that HPF themselves may yield greater energy intake and eating despite satiation, measured in real-time and free-living conditions.},

Across countries, items identified as HPF substantially exceeded HPF threshold criteria by 70–229\%. Foods identified as being both HPF and ultra-processed foods ranged from 33\% (Bulgaria) to 50\% (US). Overall, findings from 17 countries across Europe, North America, and South America highlighted foods from the US as being more likely to be hyper-palatable relative to most other countries examined.

	abstract = {BackgroundFood craving plays a significant role in food choice and excess energy intake. While prior research has predominantly examined food craving as a general construct (e.g., craving for foods overall), this approach may obscure important variability in craving for specific foods. The current study aimed to address this limitation by examining craving for specific foods (food-item level) and examining differences across sex in food item craving, while controlling for overall food craving.MethodsThe sample (N = 583) was collected via crowdsourcing. The Food Craving Inventory was used to assess craving for 28 food items. Using item response theory (IRT), a partial credit model was employed to investigate which food item was easier or more commonly craved, while holding overall food craving level constant across participants. Differential item functioning (DIF) analysis identified sex differences in craving for specific food items, with effect sizes calculated to interpret the magnitude of DIF.ResultsThe partial credit model revealed that pizza and chocolate were the easiest or most commonly craved, while gravy and cornbread were the most difficult to crave. DIF analysis suggested that savory items were more difficult (or less commonly) craved among females with medium effect sizes (i.e., Cohen's D) ranging from 0.53 to 0.80, whereas sweets were more difficult for males to crave, with effect sizes ranging from 0.42 to 0.49.ConclusionFindings indicated that food craving may vary depending on specific foods and sex.},

	abstract = {Added sugar consumption is contraindicated for infants {\textless} 2 years old; however added sugars are present in many US infant formulas. We examined whether US formulas contain primarily added sugars, or whether formulas contain primarily naturally occurring lactose (the sugar in human milk). Data were obtained from the Nutrition Data System for Research and included formulas available on the US market in 2022 (N = 73). Formulas were categorized as: standard (n = 31), gentle (n = 27), and lactose-free (n = 15). Differences across formulas were examined using Bayesian modeling. The median percent added sugars were high in standard (M=59.7 \%; IQR=22.0), gentle (M=85.0 \%; IQR=39.5), and lactose-free formulas (M=90.0 \%; IQR=54.3). Gentle formulas had significantly lower proportional lactose (OR=0.22, 95 \% HDI=[0.11,0.44], pd=99.3 \%) and {\textgreater} 2 fold higher proportional added sugars compared to standard formulas (ORs=2.11–2.57, HDI{\textgreater}0, pd=99.1–99.99 \%). Lactose-free formulas had 4–8 times higher proportional sucrose (OR=8.92, HDI=[3.86,20.8], pd=100 \%) and maltose (OR=4.91, HDI=[2.51,9.56], pd=100 \%) relative to standard and gentle formulas. Five formulas contained primarily (70–90 \%) naturally occurring lactose. In conclusion, most US infant formulas contain primarily added sugars. However, the presence of five formulas containing primarily naturally occurring lactose demonstrates that such formulations are feasible to produce; such formulas should be made more widely available to help promote infant health.},

	abstract = {Objective There is ongoing discussion about whether sports participation is a risk or protective factor for eating disorders (EDs). Research is mixed, with some studies suggesting that athletes have higher mean levels of ED psychopathology compared to nonathletes, while other studies suggest the opposite effect or no differences. The purpose of the current meta-analysis was to identify whether female athletes reported higher mean levels of ED psychopathology compared to nonathletes. Method Following PRISMA guidelines, we identified 56 studies that reported ED psychopathology for female athletes and nonathletes. A three-level random-effects model of between- and within-study variance was completed for the following outcome variables: overall ED psychopathology, body dissatisfaction, drive for thinness, restricting, and loss-of-control eating. Results Athletes reported lower levels of body dissatisfaction compared to nonathletes (g = −.21, p {\textless} .0001). Athletes and nonathletes reported similar levels of overall ED psychopathology, drive for thinness, restricting, and loss-of-control eating on average. Sport type significantly moderated standardized mean difference effect sizes of ED psychopathology in athletes versus nonathletes. Effect sizes comparing levels of drive for thinness, restricting, and loss-of-control eating in athletes versus nonathletes were larger for studies with athletes participating in aesthetic/lean sports compared to nonaesthetic/nonlean sports. Discussion Findings from this meta-analysis could inform future ED prevention and treatment in female athletes by providing further evidence that athletes in aesthetic/lean sports may report higher levels of ED psychopathology. Participating in nonaesthetic/nonlean sports may be a protective factor for experiencing less body dissatisfaction. Public Significance Statement The current meta-analysis summarized findings from 56 studies that assessed levels of disordered eating, body dissatisfaction, dietary restricting, and loss-of-control eating in female athletes and nonathletes. Athletes reported lower levels of body dissatisfaction compared to nonathletes, highlighting that participation in sport could have some protective factors. Athletes participating in sports that require weight categories (e.g., judo) and sports that emphasize thinness/leanness (e.g., gymnastics and distance running) had higher levels of disordered eating relative to athletes participating in other types of sports that do not emphasize thinness/leanness (e.g., volleyball and basketball).},
