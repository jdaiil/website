## Abstract

This study aimed to validate the Korean version of the Clinical Video game Addiction Test 2.0 (C-VAT 2.0). The C-VAT 2.0 scale developed by Van Rooij, Schoenmakers, and Van de Mheen(2017) were translated into Korean and back-translated into English to check its accuracy. A sample of 714 college students were recruited from online survey. A field test of the psychometric properties of the scale was conducted using exploratory factor analysis(EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis(CFA). The EFA results suggested one-factor model and 11 items that the original scale is composed of. The CFA results showed aceeptable goodness of model fit, and reliability coefficient(KR-20) was acceptable(.743). Convergent and concurrent validity were confirmed by conducting correlation test using Korean version of the Internet Gaming Disorder Scale, Korean Beck Depression Inventory-II, Korean Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Korean version of the Brief Self-Control Scale. The Korean version of the C-VAT 2.0 appeared to be acceptable, reliable, and valid instrument. Implications of this study were discussed.
