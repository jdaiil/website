While prior research has predominantly examined food craving as a general construct (e.g., craving for foods overall), this approach may obscure important variability in craving for specific foods. The current study aimed to address this limitation by examining craving for specific foods (food-item level) and examining differences across sex in food item craving, while controlling for overall food craving.MethodsThe sample (N = 583) was collected via crowdsourcing. The Food Craving Inventory was used to assess craving for 28 food items. Using item response theory (IRT), a partial credit model was employed to investigate which food item was easier or more commonly craved, while holding overall food craving level constant across participants. Differential item functioning (DIF) analysis identified sex differences in craving for specific food items, with effect sizes calculated to interpret the magnitude of DIF.ResultsThe partial credit model revealed that pizza and chocolate were the easiest or most commonly craved, while gravy and cornbread were the most difficult to crave. DIF analysis suggested that savory items were more difficult (or less commonly) craved among females with medium effect sizes (i.e., Cohen's D) ranging from 0.53 to 0.80, whereas sweets were more difficult for males to crave, with effect sizes ranging from 0.42 to 0.49.ConclusionFindings indicated that food craving may vary depending on specific foods and sex.\n@article{jun_beyond_2025,\n  title = {Beyond general food craving: sex differences in food-specific craving identified using item response theory},\n  volume = {16},\n  url = {https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1588999/full},\n  doi = {10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1588999},\n  journal = {Frontiers in Psychology},\n  author = {Daiil Jun and Sean Joo and Tera L.

The study examined patterns in HPF availability, nutrient characteristics, and overlap with ultra-processed foods (UPF) across countries from a globally crowdsourced, open-source dataset. Food data (N = 314229 food items) from 17 countries were analyzed. Compared to the US, foods from most European countries examined, as well as Canada and Mexico, were significantly less likely to be identified as HPF (ORs = 0.70 to 0.93) and had lower \\% of calories from fat, sugar, starchy carbohydrates, and sodium compared to HPF items from the US (ORs = 0.76 to 0.98). Across countries, items identified as HPF substantially exceeded HPF threshold criteria by 70–229\\%. Foods identified as being both HPF and ultra-processed foods ranged from 33\\% (Bulgaria) to 50\\% (US). Overall, findings from 17 countries across Europe, North America, and South America highlighted foods from the US as being more likely to be hyper-palatable relative to most other countries examined. Results highlighted variability in the degree to which foods met criteria as HFP and UPF across countries.\n@article{jun_examination_2025,\n  title = {Examination of hyper-palatable foods and their nutrient characteristics using globally crowdsourced data},\n  volume = {20},\n  url = {https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0325479},\n  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0325479},\n  number = {6},\n  journal = {PLOS ONE},\n  author = {Daiil Jun and Kelly Knowles and Tera L.

Due to their strong reinforcing properties, HPF are hypothesized to lead to greater energy intake within a meal. However, this premise has not been tested in free-living conditions. The current study examined the association between within-meal HPF intake and 1) measured energy intake and 2) self-reported overeating, assessed within eating occasions using smartphone-based food photography methodology.\nMethods\nA total of 29 participants reported food intake and eating experiences (N=345 total eating occasions) in real-time for 4 days using smartphone-based food photography methodology. HPF were identified using a standardized definition. Bayesian multilevel modeling was conducted to investigate the within-person effects of proportional calorie intake from HPF (\\%kcal from HPF) on total energy intake and subjective overeating. Pre-meal hunger and proportional energy intake from high energy dense (HED) foods were included as covariates.\nResults\nResults revealed that when participants consumed more \\%kcal from HPF than their average, they consumed greater total energy during eating occasions, even when controlling for pre-meal hunger and \\%kcal from HED foods (median β = 0.09, 95\\% HDI [0.02, 0.16], pd. = 99.56\\%). Additionally, consuming more \\%kcal from HPF than average was associated with greater eating despite feeling full, when controlling covariates (median β = 0.15, 95\\% HDI [-0.02, 0.34], pd = 96.45\\%).\nConclusions\nThe findings supported the premise that HPF themselves may yield greater energy intake and eating despite satiation, measured in real-time and free-living conditions.\n@article{jun_role_2025,\n  title = {The role of hyper-palatable foods in energy intake measured using mobile food photography methodology},\n  volume = {57},\n  url = {https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471015325000431},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.eatbeh.2025.101983},\n  journal = {Eating Behaviors},\n  author = {Daiil Jun and Jeffrey M.

However, recent research revealed that most US-produced infant formulas contain added sugars. The current study examined the proportion of added sugars in US infant formulas to determine whether US formulas contain primarily added sugars, which may present a risk to infant metabolic health, or whether formulas contain primarily naturally occurring lactose (the sugar present in human breast milk).\nMethods: Data were obtained from the Nutrition Data System for Research and represented US the infant formula market as of 2022 (N=73). Formulas were categorized into three mutually exclusive types by their marketing labels: standard (n=31), gentle (n=27), and lactose-free (n=15). The proportion of added sugars from each type of sugar was calculated, as was the percent of naturally occurring lactose. Differences across formula types were examined using Bayesian modeling.\nResults: The median percent added sugars was high in standard (M=59.7\\%; IQR=22.0), gentle (M=85.0\\%; IQR=39.5), and lactose-free formulas (M=90.0\\%; IQR=54.3). Gentle formulas had significantly lower proportional lactose (OR=0.22, 95\\% HDI=[0.11, 0.44]\n@misc{rips-goodwin_us_2024,\n  title = {{US} {Infant} {Formulas} {Contain} {Primarily} {Added} {Sugars}: {An} {Analysis} of the {Infant} {Formulas} on the {US} {Market}},\n  url = {https://osf.io/vhkeu},\n  doi = {10.31234/osf.io/vhkeu},\n  publisher = {PsyArXiv},\n  author = {Audrey Rips-Goodwin and Daiil Jun and Adrianne Griebel-Thompson and Kai Ling Kong and Tera Fazzino},\n  month = {nov},\n  year = {2024},\n  note = {Last visited on 02/20/2025}\n}\n\n\n\n\nUS tobacco companies selectively disseminated hyper-palatable foods into the US food system: Empirical evidence and current implications\n\n\nFazzino, Jun, Chollet-Hinton & Bjorlie\n\nAddiction\n\n\nAbstract\nCitation\nBibTeX\n\n\nCopy\nCopied!\n—\n\n\n\nBackground and aims US tobacco companies owned leading US food companies from 1980 to 2001. We measured whether hyper-palatable foods (HPF) were disproportionately developed in tobacco-owned food companies, resulting in substantial tobacco-related influence on the US food system. Design The study involved a review of primary industry documents to identify food brands that were tobacco company-owned. Data sets from the US Department of Agriculture were integrated to facilitate longitudinal analyses estimating the degree to which foods were formulated to be hyper-palatable, based on tobacco ownership. Setting and cases United States Department of Agriculture data sets were used to identify HPF foods that were (n = 105) and were not (n = 587) owned by US tobacco companies from 1988 to 2001. Measurements A standardized definition from Fazzino et al. (2019) was used to identify HPF. HPF items were identified overall and by HPF group: fat and sodium HPF, fat and sugar HPF and carbohydrates and sodium HPF. Findings Tobacco-owned foods were 29\\% more likely to be classified as fat and sodium HPF and 80\\% more likely to be classified as carbohydrate and sodium HPF than foods that were not tobacco-owned between 1988 and 2001 (P-values = 0.005–0.009). The availability of fat and sodium HPF ({\\textgreater} 57\\%) and carbohydrate and sodium HPF ({\\textgreater} 17\\%) was high in 2018 regardless of prior tobacco-ownership status, suggesting widespread saturation into the food system. Conclusions Tobacco companies appear to have selectively disseminated hyper-palatable foods into the US food system between 1988 and 2001.\n@article{fazzino_us_2024,\n  title = {{US} tobacco companies selectively disseminated hyper-palatable foods into the {US} food system: {Empirical} evidence and current implications},\n  volume = {119},\n  url = {https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/add.16332},\n  doi = {10.1111/add.16332},\n  number = {1},\n  journal = {Addiction},\n  author = {Tera L.
