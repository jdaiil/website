The long-term objective is to leverage this understanding to develop real-time, personalized monitoring tools that can enhance psychiatric assessment and facilitate preemptive interventions. This work integrates addiction science with advanced computational and statistical methods to study behavior from a within-person perspective.\n\n\n\nMaladaptive Eating and Hyper-Palatable Foods\nA primary focus of my research is to understand the inherent properties of certain foods that may promote addictive-like eating behaviors. This work examines the characteristics of hyper-palatable foods and their influence on the food environment and individual eating behaviors.\nMy research has: - Identified the historical role of U.S. tobacco companies in the dissemination of hyper-palatable foods into the U.S. food system. - Empirically demonstrated that real-time consumption of these foods is associated with increased energy intake and experiences of overeating, using ecological momentary assessment and remote food photography methods. - Used Item Response Theory to identify sex differences in food-specific cravings. - Included a systematic review of ecological momentary assessment studies on food craving.\n\n\n\nComputational Psychiatry and Digital Phenotyping\nMy work extends the concept of reward dysfunction to its role as a transdiagnostic mechanism in individuals with Serious Mental Illness (SMI). In collaboration with Dr. Justin Baker’s team at McLean Hospital, I apply computational methods to complex, intensive longitudinal data from outpatients with affective and psychotic disorders.\nThis research analyzes daily symptom reports, audio diaries, and clinical interviews to uncover transdiagnostic symptom structures and their associations with objective features of speech. A significant component of this work involves leveraging large language models (LLMs) to derive clinically meaningful information from naturalistic speech, such as assessing sentiment.\n\n\nSubstance Use and Reward-Driven Behaviors\nThis line of research investigates the shared mechanisms that link substance use with other reward-driven health behaviors. My dissertation examines the acute effects of alcohol consumption on the momentary valuation of hyper-palatable foods, utilizing ecological momentary assessment to capture these dynamics in real-time. The first work in this topic investigated the associations between alcohol-free sources of reinforcement and the frequency of alcohol and cannabis co-use in college students."

While prior research has predominantly examined food craving as a general construct (e.g., craving for foods overall), this approach may obscure important variability in craving for specific foods. The current study aimed to address this limitation by examining craving for specific foods (food-item level) and examining differences across sex in food item craving, while controlling for overall food craving.MethodsThe sample (N = 583) was collected via crowdsourcing. The Food Craving Inventory was used to assess craving for 28 food items. Using item response theory (IRT), a partial credit model was employed to investigate which food item was easier or more commonly craved, while holding overall food craving level constant across participants. Differential item functioning (DIF) analysis identified sex differences in craving for specific food items, with effect sizes calculated to interpret the magnitude of DIF.ResultsThe partial credit model revealed that pizza and chocolate were the easiest or most commonly craved, while gravy and cornbread were the most difficult to crave. DIF analysis suggested that savory items were more difficult (or less commonly) craved among females with medium effect sizes (i.e., Cohen's D) ranging from 0.53 to 0.80, whereas sweets were more difficult for males to crave, with effect sizes ranging from 0.42 to 0.49.ConclusionFindings indicated that food craving may vary depending on specific foods and sex.\n@article{jun_beyond_2025,\n  title = {Beyond general food craving: sex differences in food-specific craving identified using item response theory},\n  volume = {16},\n  url = {https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1588999/full},\n  doi = {10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1588999},\n  journal = {Frontiers in Psychology},\n  author = {Daiil Jun and Sean Joo and Tera L.

The study examined patterns in HPF availability, nutrient characteristics, and overlap with ultra-processed foods (UPF) across countries from a globally crowdsourced, open-source dataset. Food data (N = 314229 food items) from 17 countries were analyzed. Compared to the US, foods from most European countries examined, as well as Canada and Mexico, were significantly less likely to be identified as HPF (ORs = 0.70 to 0.93) and had lower \\% of calories from fat, sugar, starchy carbohydrates, and sodium compared to HPF items from the US (ORs = 0.76 to 0.98). Across countries, items identified as HPF substantially exceeded HPF threshold criteria by 70–229\\%. Foods identified as being both HPF and ultra-processed foods ranged from 33\\% (Bulgaria) to 50\\% (US). Overall, findings from 17 countries across Europe, North America, and South America highlighted foods from the US as being more likely to be hyper-palatable relative to most other countries examined.

Due to their strong reinforcing properties, HPF are hypothesized to lead to greater energy intake within a meal. However, this premise has not been tested in free-living conditions. The current study examined the association between within-meal HPF intake and 1) measured energy intake and 2) self-reported overeating, assessed within eating occasions using smartphone-based food photography methodology.\nMethods\nA total of 29 participants reported food intake and eating experiences (N=345 total eating occasions) in real-time for 4 days using smartphone-based food photography methodology. HPF were identified using a standardized definition. Bayesian multilevel modeling was conducted to investigate the within-person effects of proportional calorie intake from HPF (\\%kcal from HPF) on total energy intake and subjective overeating. Pre-meal hunger and proportional energy intake from high energy dense (HED) foods were included as covariates.\nResults\nResults revealed that when participants consumed more \\%kcal from HPF than their average, they consumed greater total energy during eating occasions, even when controlling for pre-meal hunger and \\%kcal from HED foods (median β = 0.09, 95\\% HDI [0.02, 0.16], pd. = 99.56\\%). Additionally, consuming more \\%kcal from HPF than average was associated with greater eating despite feeling full, when controlling covariates (median β = 0.15, 95\\% HDI [-0.02, 0.34], pd = 96.45\\%).\nConclusions\nThe findings supported the premise that HPF themselves may yield greater energy intake and eating despite satiation, measured in real-time and free-living conditions.\n@article{jun_role_2025,\n  title = {The role of hyper-palatable foods in energy intake measured using mobile food photography methodology},\n  volume = {57},\n  url = {https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471015325000431},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.eatbeh.2025.101983},\n  journal = {Eating Behaviors},\n  author = {Daiil Jun and Jeffrey M.

We measured whether hyper-palatable foods (HPF) were disproportionately developed in tobacco-owned food companies, resulting in substantial tobacco-related influence on the US food system. Design The study involved a review of primary industry documents to identify food brands that were tobacco company-owned. Data sets from the US Department of Agriculture were integrated to facilitate longitudinal analyses estimating the degree to which foods were formulated to be hyper-palatable, based on tobacco ownership. Setting and cases United States Department of Agriculture data sets were used to identify HPF foods that were (n = 105) and were not (n = 587) owned by US tobacco companies from 1988 to 2001. Measurements A standardized definition from Fazzino et al. (2019) was used to identify HPF. HPF items were identified overall and by HPF group: fat and sodium HPF, fat and sugar HPF and carbohydrates and sodium HPF. Findings Tobacco-owned foods were 29\\% more likely to be classified as fat and sodium HPF and 80\\% more likely to be classified as carbohydrate and sodium HPF than foods that were not tobacco-owned between 1988 and 2001 (P-values = 0.005–0.009). The availability of fat and sodium HPF ({\\textgreater} 57\\%) and carbohydrate and sodium HPF ({\\textgreater} 17\\%) was high in 2018 regardless of prior tobacco-ownership status, suggesting widespread saturation into the food system. Conclusions Tobacco companies appear to have selectively disseminated hyper-palatable foods into the US food system between 1988 and 2001.\n@article{fazzino_us_2024,\n  title = {{US} tobacco companies selectively disseminated hyper-palatable foods into the {US} food system: {Empirical} evidence and current implications},\n  volume = {119},\n  url = {https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/add.16332},\n  doi = {10.1111/add.16332},\n  number = {1},\n  journal = {Addiction},\n  author = {Tera L.

A behavioral economics framework indicates that greater engagement in substance-free sources of reinforcement may be protective against co-use frequency. The current study tested the association between proportionate alcohol-free reinforcement and the frequency of co-use among college freshmen. Participants (N = 86) were freshmen who enrolled in a freshman orientation course and completed surveys at the beginning of the semester. Past month alcohol use, cannabis use, and reinforcement from alcohol-free and alcohol-involved activities were assessed. A zero-inflated Poisson regression was used to test the association between proportionate alcohol-free reinforcement and days of co-use. The results indicated that proportionate alcohol-free reinforcement was negatively associated with co-use days in the count model when controlling for alcohol use days and gender as covariates (β: −3.28, p = 0.016). Proportionate alcohol-free reinforcement did not significantly differentiate individuals who did not engage in co-use in the zero-inflated model (β: −1.68, p = 0.497). The study suggested that greater proportionate alcohol-free reinforcement may be associated with lower engagement in the co-use of alcohol and cannabis among young adults. Increasing engagement in alcohol-free sources of reinforcement may be considered a target for co-use prevention or harm reduction efforts.\n@article{jun_associations_2023,\n  title = {Associations between {Alcohol}-{Free} {Sources} of {Reinforcement} and the {Frequency} of {Alcohol} and {Cannabis} {Co}-{Use} among {College} {Freshmen}},\n  volume = {20},\n  url = {https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/4/2884},\n  doi = {10.3390/ijerph20042884},\n  number = {4},\n  journal = {International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health},\n  author = {Daiil Jun and Tera L.

Research is mixed, with some studies suggesting that athletes have higher mean levels of ED psychopathology compared to nonathletes, while other studies suggest the opposite effect or no differences. The purpose of the current meta-analysis was to identify whether female athletes reported higher mean levels of ED psychopathology compared to nonathletes. Method Following PRISMA guidelines, we identified 56 studies that reported ED psychopathology for female athletes and nonathletes. A three-level random-effects model of between- and within-study variance was completed for the following outcome variables: overall ED psychopathology, body dissatisfaction, drive for thinness, restricting, and loss-of-control eating. Results Athletes reported lower levels of body dissatisfaction compared to nonathletes (g = −.21, p {\\textless} .0001). Athletes and nonathletes reported similar levels of overall ED psychopathology, drive for thinness, restricting, and loss-of-control eating on average. Sport type significantly moderated standardized mean difference effect sizes of ED psychopathology in athletes versus nonathletes. Effect sizes comparing levels of drive for thinness, restricting, and loss-of-control eating in athletes versus nonathletes were larger for studies with athletes participating in aesthetic/lean sports compared to nonaesthetic/nonlean sports. Discussion Findings from this meta-analysis could inform future ED prevention and treatment in female athletes by providing further evidence that athletes in aesthetic/lean sports may report higher levels of ED psychopathology. Participating in nonaesthetic/nonlean sports may be a protective factor for experiencing less body dissatisfaction. Public Significance Statement The current meta-analysis summarized findings from 56 studies that assessed levels of disordered eating, body dissatisfaction, dietary restricting, and loss-of-control eating in female athletes and nonathletes. Athletes reported lower levels of body dissatisfaction compared to nonathletes, highlighting that participation in sport could have some protective factors. Athletes participating in sports that require weight categories (e.g., judo) and sports that emphasize thinness/leanness (e.g., gymnastics and distance running) had higher levels of disordered eating relative to athletes participating in other types of sports that do not emphasize thinness/leanness (e.g., volleyball and basketball).\n@article{chapa_eating-disorder_2022,\n  title = {Eating-disorder psychopathology in female athletes and non-athletes: {A} meta-analysis},\n  volume = {55},\n  url = {https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eat.23748},\n  doi = {10.1002/eat.23748},\n  number = {7},\n  journal = {International Journal of Eating Disorders},\n  author = {Danielle A.
