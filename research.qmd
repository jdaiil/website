My research interests seek to understand the transdiagnostic mechanisms of reward dysfunction that bridge maladaptive eating, substance use, and serious mental illness (SMI). The long-term objective is to leverage this understanding to develop real-time, personalized monitoring tools that can enhance psychiatric assessment and facilitate preemptive interventions. This work integrates addiction science with advanced computational and statistical methods to study behavior from a within-person perspective.

### Maladaptive Eating and Hyper-Palatable Foods

A primary focus of my research is to understand the inherent properties of certain foods that may promote addictive-like eating behaviors. This work examines the characteristics of hyper-palatable foods and their influence on the food environment and individual eating behaviors. 

My research has:
- Identified the historical role of U.S. tobacco companies in the dissemination of hyper-palatable foods into the U.S. food system.
- Empirically demonstrated that real-time consumption of these foods is associated with increased energy intake and experiences of overeating, using ecological momentary assessment and remote food photography methods.
- Used Item Response Theory to identify sex differences in food-specific cravings.
- Included a systematic review of ecological momentary assessment studies on food craving.

### Computational Psychiatry and Digital Phenotyping

My work extends the concept of reward dysfunction to its role as a transdiagnostic mechanism in individuals with Serious Mental Illness (SMI). In collaboration with Dr. Justin Bakerâ€™s team at McLean Hospital, I apply computational methods to complex, intensive longitudinal data from outpatients with affective and psychotic disorders. 

This research analyzes daily symptom reports, audio diaries, and clinical interviews to uncover transdiagnostic symptom structures and their associations with objective features of speech. A significant component of this work involves leveraging large language models (LLMs) to derive clinically meaningful information from naturalistic speech, such as assessing sentiment.

### Substance Use and Reward-Driven Behaviors

This line of research investigates the shared mechanisms that link substance use with other reward-driven health behaviors. My dissertation examines the acute effects of alcohol consumption on the momentary valuation of hyper-palatable foods, utilizing ecological momentary assessment to capture these dynamics in real-time. The first work in this topic investigated the associations between alcohol-free sources of reinforcement and the frequency of alcohol and cannabis co-use in college students.
