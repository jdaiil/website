subtitle: "My research seeks to understand the transdiagnostic mechanisms of reward dysfunction that bridge maladaptive eating, substance use, and serious mental illness (SMI). The long-term goal is to leverage this understanding to develop real-time, personalized monitoring tools that can enhance psychiatric assessment and facilitate preemptive interventions."

### üçî Maladaptive Eating & Hyper-Palatable Foods

Understanding the properties of foods that promote addictive-like eating, focusing on the food environment and individual behaviors.

**Key Projects:**

-   Investigated the historical role of U.S. tobacco companies in disseminating hyper-palatable foods.
-   Demonstrated that real-time consumption of these foods is associated with increased energy intake using EMA.
-   Used Item Response Theory to identify sex differences in food-specific cravings.
-   Systematic review of EMA studies on food craving.

### üíª Precision & Computational Psychiatry

Applying computational methods to understand transdiagnostic mechanisms in SMI and to leverage novel technology (e.g, LLMs) for enhancing clinical assessment. 

**Key Projects:**

-   Analyzed a intensive longitudinal data set to understand transdiagnostic symptom changes in relation to daily symptoms and speech features from outpatients with affective and psychotic disorders.
-   Leveraged large language models (LLMs) to derive clinically meaningful information (e.g., sentiment) from naturalistic speech.
-   Using LLMs to classify PTSD conditions based on patients' interview transcripts.

### üç∑ Substance Use & Reward-Driven Behaviors

Investigating shared mechanisms linking substance use with other reward-driven health behaviors, particularly food valuation.

**Key Projects:**

-   **(Dissertation)** proposed to examine acute effects of alcohol on the momentary valuation of hyper-palatable foods using EMA.
-   Studied links between alcohol-free reinforcement and co-use of alcohol and cannabis in college students.
