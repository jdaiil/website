Welcome to my website!

I am Daiil (pronounced Dale) who is currently a Ph.D student in Clinical Psychological Science at the University of Kansas. I am originally from Seoul, South Korea. My research interest is applying advanced statistical methods to understanding addictive behaviors. I am interested in especially cross-sensitization across different addictive behaviors. Currently, my research is mostly about understanding shared mechanism of eating hyper-palatable foods and addiction.
