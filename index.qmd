**Welcome to my website!**

I am Daiil (pronounced Dale), a Ph.D. Candidate in the Clinical Psychological Science program at the University of Kansas. I am under the dual mentorship of [Dr. Tera Fazzino](https://fazzinolab.ku.edu/people/tera-fazzino) and [Dr.Jeffrey Girard](https://psychology.ku.edu/people/jeffrey-girard).

My research interest is to understand the transdiagnostic mechanisms of reward dysfunction that bridge maladaptive eating, substance use, and serious mental illness (SMI). My long-term goal is to leverage this understanding to develop real-time, personalized monitoring tools that can enhance psychiatric assessment and enable preemptive interventions.
