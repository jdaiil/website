### Welcome!

I am Daiil (pronounced Dale) who is a Ph.D Candidate in Clinical Psychological Science program at the University of Kansas. Currently, I am under dual mentorship from [Dr. Fazzino](https://fazzinolab.ku.edu/people/tera-fazzino) and [Dr. Girard](https://psychology.ku.edu/people/jeffrey-girard). My research interest is to understand the transdiagnostic mechanisms of reward dysfunction that bridge maladaptive eating, substance use, and serious mental illness (SMI). My long-term goal is to leverage this understanding to develop real-time, personalized monitoring tools that can enhance psychiatric assessment and enable preemptive interventions.
